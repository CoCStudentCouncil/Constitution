  the institute as a whole.

## Section 2. Alumni Members:
Graduated students who would be eligible to be a student member if they had not graduated are considered to be alumni
members.

## Section 3. Discipline of Members:
Members violating Georgia Tech policies, or disrupting the meetings may face disciplinary action banning them from this
organization for a limited amount of time. Bylaws describe the process to be followed for the discipline of members.

# Article V: Officers

At all times there will be two boards of student members, referred to as the Executive Board and the Student Advisory

## Section 1. Executive Board Members:
The Executive Board ensures that this organization is effectively run. Only student members can run for the Executive
Board. The Executive Board shall be comprised of three members:

  bylaws, and establish the link between the students and the CoC administration. Bylaws define the details of the
  responsibilities of the chairs.

  minutes and resolutions as well as maintaining the online presence of this organization. Bylaws define the details of
  the responsibilities of the secretary.

## Section 2. Student Advisory Board Members:
The Student Advisory Board shall serve as a representative body elected by the students of the CoC to advise the

# Article VI: Election of Officers

## Section 1. General Election Procedures:
All officer elections will happen by closed ballot. Only student members can vote in the officer elections. Members will
fill out their ballots by ranking all of their preferred candidates from most to least preferred. The winner will be
decided using an alternative vote (instant runoff) system. From the Encyclopedia Britannica:

> “Alternative vote (AV), also called instant runoff, method of election [is one] in which voters rank candidates in
> order of preference. If any single candidate receives a majority of first-preference votes, that candidate is deemed
> elected. If no candidate clears this hurdle, the last-place candidate is eliminated and that candidate’s second
> preferences are reapportioned to others and so on until a candidate clears the threshold of 50 percent of the vote
> plus one.”

At the meeting where officer elections are to be held, each nominee should be allowed to speak on their own behalf
before the vote occurs. This includes explaining why they wish to hold the position and what qualifies them to hold the
position.

Before the election is to be held, the candidates are to leave the room so that private discussions can occur among the
voting members. The candidates themselves do not get a vote.

Once a motion to vote is called and seconded, the vote will be conducted. The Executive Board will decide tie votes in
the event that no candidate is able to achieve a majority vote after all iterations of the alternative vote.

## Section 2. Elections for the Executive Board:
Elections for the Executive Board shall happen by closed ballot in the last meeting of the Fall and Spring semesters for
the following semester (being Spring and Fall respectively). Any student member can be nominated, nominate themselves,
or vote in the elections. Once elected, officers will assume office at the next Town Hall meeting and serve until the
officers selected in the following election assume the office. Officers are expected to ensure that the transition
between themselves and and the new officers happens smoothly.

## Section 3. Elections for the Student Advisory Board:
Elections for the Advisory Board shall happen by closed ballot in the last meeting of the Fall and Spring semesters for
the following semester (being Spring and Fall respectively). Once elected, officers will assume office at the next Town
Hall meeting and serve until the officers selected in the following election assume the office. For each position in the
Student Advisory Board, only the members who are eligible to run for the position can vote, with the SGA representatives
(who are elected by SGA procedures), and the Student Organizations Council representative (who is elected by Student
Organizations Council procedures) being exceptions. Members willing to participate in the election should follow the
specific procedures set by the Chairs to prove their eligibility to run/vote for a particular category. Chairs should
announce the verification procedures in the meeting prior to the election meeting, and these details should also be made
clear in the public announcement of the meeting. Once elected, officers shall serve for one semester, and will assume
office at the next Town Hall meeting. Officers are expected to ensure that the transition between new and old officers
happens smoothly.

# Article VII: Removal of Officers

## Section 1:
Procedure for Removing an Officer: Any member may start a motion to remove an officer during a Town Hall meeting where
quorum is present. Majority of the present members shall second the motion so that the removal of the officer be voted
upon with closed ballot during the following Town Hall meeting. It is required that this vote be announced publicly
prior to the beginning of this subsequent Town Hall.

## Section 2:
Rights of the Officer in Question: In the event that members elect to vote to remove an officer, the officer in question
has the following rights:

* The right to be aware that the vote will occur (this means that the other officers on the Executive and Advisory
  boards must make a good-faith effort to inform the officer in question of the vote and how to attend it),
* The right to attend the meeting where the vote will occur,
* The right to address the members for 10 minutes at the beginning of the meeting where the vote will occur in order to
  defend his/her actions.

## Section 3. Vote for the Removal of Executive Board Members:
An Executive Board member shall be removed in either of the following cases:

1. With the approval of the other two Executive Board members and the majority vote in a closed ballot voting in a Town
   Hall.
2. Two-thirds votes in a closed ballot voting in a Town Hall.

## Section 4. Replacement of Executive Board Members:
If an officer is removed or cannot hold the position for other reasons, the remaining Executive Board Members should
organize an election in the earliest Town Hall allowing a nomination period of at least one week. The remaining
Executive Board Members will appoint a temporary replacement in the interim. In the event that all Executive Board
members have been removed or cannot hold their positions anymore, the Advisory Board Members should assume the Executive
Board Member responsibilities described here for the replacement.

## Section 5. Vote for the Removal of Student Advisory Board Members:
A Student Advisory Board member shall be removed in either of the following cases:
1. With the approval of the majority of the Student Advisory Board and a majority vote in a closed ballot voting in a
   Town Hall.
2. Two-thirds votes in a closed ballot voting in a Town Hall.

## Section 6. Replacement of Student Advisory Board Members:
If an officer is removed or cannot hold the position for other reasons, the Executive Board Members should organize an
election in the earliest Town Hall allowing a nomination period of at least one week. The remaining Executive Board
Members will appoint a temporary replacement in the interim. In the event that all Executive Board members have been
removed or cannot hold their positions anymore, the Advisory Board Members should assume the Executive Board Member
responsibilities described here for the replacement. Exceptionally, if an SGA representative is removed or cannot hold
the position for other reasons, the position will be left unfilled; if a Student Organizations representative is removed
or cannot hold the position for other reasons, their respective member organizations will be requested to perform
another election by their own process, otherwise the position will be left unfilled.

# Article VIII: Meetings

## Section 1. Town Halls:
Town Halls are the main meetings of Student Council. Officer elections and the changes to the constitution or bylaws can
only be made during the Town Halls, when a quorum is present. Town Halls have to be announced publicly through email
between one and two weeks before the planned date and time. At least one Town Hall meeting is to be held each month
during the Spring and Fall semesters. The executive board is free to call more meetings than the minimum, and a meeting
may also be called through a motion supported by a majority of the members when a quorum is present.

## Section 2. Town Hall Resolution:
At the end of each Town Hall meeting, a resolution summarizing the decisions made should be prepared. The goal of the
resolution is to ensure that issues discussed within the meetings are communicated to the office of the top level of the
CoC administration. To add a statement to the resolution, a student member should raise a motion to open the discussion
on it. Once the discussion has ended, the statement can be added to the resolution with a motion, which needs to be
seconded by at least one other person. The statement can be amended during the discussion by the student member who
raised it. The statements in the resolution should be ordered according to the number of members who seconded the motion
to add it, with the most supported statement appearing at the top of the resolution. The Executive Board is responsible
for scheduling a meeting with the CoC administration following the Town Hall where the statements on this resolution
will be discussed.

## Section 3. Parliamentary Procedure:
The Chairs will moderate discussions according to Robert’s Rules of Order during Town Hall meetings. Robert’s Rules of
Order shall also be used in instances not covered within this constitution.

## Section 4. Quorum:
Quorum of the membership shall be 30 student members.

# Article IX: Finances

 Student Council shall not have any dues.

# Article X: Amendments

 The amendments to this constitution shall be made in writing to the membership, a week before the meeting where the
 amendment will be voted upon. Amendments can be amended by majority vote when quorum is present, before the voting for
 the amendment starts. When voting for the amendment, quorum should be present and the amendment should receive
 two-thirds of the present votes to pass. The amended constitution should be made available to all the members and the
 CoC administration within 48 hours.
